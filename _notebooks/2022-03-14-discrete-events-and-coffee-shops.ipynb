    "## Discrete-event simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In a discrete-event simulation we model a system as a sequence of events that occur at discrete times. For example, in a grocery queue, the events might be: customer lines up at the queue, customer reaches cashier, and completes transactions. The entire system is modeled via events and no other state change occurs between events.\n",

    "Discrete event simulations have a large number of applications in logistics, operations and many others. They can be a useful addition in a data scientist's toolbelt.\n",

    "## Simpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpy is a Python package for discrete-event simulation. The package provides three main constructs: events, processes and resources. We will discuss resources in the Coffee Shop simulation, below we illustrate the first two constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes model components of a system by emitting events. Processes are defined by a Python generator. A generator allows for the temporary suspension of a process, and it makes it very convenient to model various components. Here is an example:"
